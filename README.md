Kernel exploitation on the PlayStation 4 (PS4) firmware 6.72 refers to taking advantage of a vulnerability within the console's kernel, which is the core part of the system software that manages hardware and software resources. This specific exploit allows users to bypass the security mechanisms that Sony has put in place, enabling them to run custom code on the PS4, such as homebrew applications or piracy tools, effectively unlocking the console for non-official use.
